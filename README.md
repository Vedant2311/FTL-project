# FTL-project

Simulating hair and fur is very common in the field of Computer Graphics. One of the main challenges for the simulations of these objects is to guarantee a zero extension in their length, since they are supposed to be non-deformable (Think of how things would be if you pull your hair along their length and they keep elongating like a spring!). One method to solve is problem is an extension of a technique called *Follow the Leader (FTL)* (http://robotics.stanford.edu/~latombe/papers/knotmaking/paper.pdf)

A method for solving this problem of Zero-stretch for dynamic simulations based on the FTL method has been presented as *Dynamic Follow the Leader (DFTL)* (https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/FTLHairFur.pdf). The main issues with the method given in that paper are as follows:

  - It has a lot of artificial damping
  - No proof of correctness was given for this method
  
This work deals with tackling with these problems to improve the DFTL give an algorithm which solves the zero extension problem, is physically accurate (in the limits of the time step size tending to zero) and does not have such high artificial damping
