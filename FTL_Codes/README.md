# FTL_Codes

All the considered implementations of the Follow the Leader (FTL) methods can be found here. You can find the Information of the different files as below:
1. **DFTL_Orig.m**: Implementation of the Published DFTL method
2. **DFTL_Quad_S.m**: Having a continuously varying s_damping
3. **FTL_Mem.m**: Applying correction on position rather than the velocity
4. **DFTL_Quad_Combined.m**: Combining Position as well as Velocity corrections
5. **FTL_combine.m**: Naively combining to DFTL updates to conserve energy
6. **FTL_SE.m**: Implementing FTL using Symplectic Euler
