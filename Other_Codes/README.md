# Other_Codes

All the codes for the standard implementations of Backward Euler and Symplectic Euler can be found here. The basic details for these are as follows:
1. **Backward_Euler.m**: Implementing Backward Euler (without constraints)
2. **CS_BE.m**: Implementing Backward Euler (with constraints)
3. **Symplectic_Euler.m**: Implementing Symplectic Euler without constraints
4. **comp.m**: Comparing the simulation of DFTL_Orig and DFTL_Quad.
